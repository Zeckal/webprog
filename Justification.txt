This is a minesweeper game for the First Team Assignment. 
We have implemented Several CSS3 features to give the game some simple context. 
This includes Boarders, font styles, backgrounds, and text shadow.
The game is not stupidly simple and does take some work to get the mine detection and adjacency numbers.
No special librarys were used.

Difficulties:
I couldn't get GameWin() and GameLose() functions to work properly, and had to insert the code directly instead of a function call
